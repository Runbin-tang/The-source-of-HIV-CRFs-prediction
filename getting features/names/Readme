The files is name of sequences which were used in paper.
Before extracting the features of sequences in the file, you need use the corresponding file to download the sequence files.
Accession number of the sequences is also showed in the file.

in the paper, Only used the following files：
1. reference_name saves  the name of reference of 44 sequences in the HIV Database.
2. polcrf2.txt and polpure2.txt save the name of pol gene of crf and pure sequence.
3. cgcrf2.txt and cgpure2.txt save the name of complete genome of crf and pure sequence.
4. cg_crf_testname.txt, cg_pure_testname.txt, pol_crf_testname.txt and pol_pure_testname.txt save the name of 4 types testdata, respectively.
5. the mix_* save the name of crf and its pure subtype, it was used when drawed the 3D MoMaps.
6. ref/* save the name of pure and crf which are used to process of test. They are randomly selected from the training set. And when generating the refdata, 
the outfilename need to be named as ‘*_ref.txt’, * represent cgcrf,cgpure,polcrf,polpure/.
